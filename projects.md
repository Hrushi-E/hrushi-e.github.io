  ## CURRENT MTECH PROJECT
  
  ### FlexTree: Gaze-Controlled Interfaces with Context-Based Letter and Word Predictions [Jan 2023 - Present]
  
  * Developed a **novel intelligent multimodal virtual tree-based text entry interface** using **Tkinter** with **audio and visual feedback** upon entering letters to detect dyslexic children.
    
  * Build a **light weight language model for English language** by **training on 300k+ token text**,  which helps **predict the next probable character** using **PPM(prediction by partial matching) and NCP(Next Character Prediction)**.
  
  * Incorporated **Eye-Tribe Eye Tracker** and **mouse** functionality for **selection of the letters** on interface.
    
  * Yet to conduct experiments and analyze results to compare with the existing **Dasher Text entry interface**.
  * Later We are planning to extend it's design for dyslexic people.
  
  
  ## BTECH PROJECTS
  
  ### Helmet Detection and License Plate Extraction Using Yolov3 and Darknet		     [Feb - June 2021]
    
  * A total of **4000 images**, with **800 per class** [ **Helmet, No Helmet, Person, Motorcycle and License plate** ], were collected using **OIDv4**. The model was trained on **90%** images using **yolov3 on darknet framework** and tested on **10%** to obtain an impressive **87.49% average precision**.
    
  * A new model was trained on **2800 meticulously curated images**, manually labeled with **LabelImg**. Testing it on a **10% subset** of the trainset yielded a remarkable **97.51% average precision**.
    
  * A **TensorFlow model** was built for **License Plate Extraction** using improved model weights.
    
  ### A web app for making and maintaining personal  ‘ToDoLists’ using Django, SQlite3, and HTML	  [Aug 2020]
    
  * Developed a simple web app where users can **log in** to **create** and **view** tasks and subtasks.
  
  * This helped me to extend my knowledge and interest in Python towards **Django, SQlite3, and HTML**.
  
  ## Other Projects
      
  ### Gold-Stock-Price-Prediction
    
  * We are building Gold stock Price Prediction on Gold stock prices taken from yfinance form "2020-01-01" to "2024-01-01"
  
  * In this project, we will develop our stock price predictor using only these two predictors. Here we are using SVM, Regression algorithms as they works best as compared to any other machine learning algorithms
  
  
  ### Loan-Prediction-System
    
  * A notebook to compare various ML algorithms to find out whether a Loan will granted or not. We use the following algorithms: Using GaussianNB, Using SVC With Grid Search CV, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree Using Randomized Search, Random Forest Using Randomized Search
  
  
  
  ### Iris-Flowers-Classification
    
  * First, we perform the data processing and understand the features used in the dataset.
  
  * We used various ML algorithms for Iris-Flowers-Classification. For each ML model, we performed Hyperparameter tuning to get the better models and report the better models.
  
  * Here are the algorithms used:
  
      1 Logistic Regression
      
      2 Decision Tree
      
      3 Random Forest
      
      4 Gradient Boosting
      
      5 SVC
      
      6 KNN
      
      7 XGBoost
  
  ### California House Price Prediction
  
  * In this project you will work on developing an end to end machine learning project using linear regression.
  
  * Our main focus will be on extensive data visualization, we will perform data feature engineering, we will also see how we can select features based on the correlation of the features.
  
  * We focus very less on model but more on understanding the problem by visualization.
  
  ### Breast-Cancer-Detection
  
  * Build Logistic Regression model from scratch for the task at hand and got accuracy of 0.883
  
  * Compared against some regression models from scikit-learn. For each ML model, we performed Hyperparameter tuning to get the better models and report the better models.
  
  * Here are the algorithms used:
  
      1 Logistic Regression
      
      2 Decision Tree
      
      3 Random Forest
      
      4 Gradient Boosting
      
      5 SVC
      
      6 KNN
      
      7 XGBoost
  
  ### Airfoil-self-noise-prediction
  
  * First, we perform the data processing and understand the features used in the dataset.
  
  * We used various ML algorithms for Airfoil-self-noise-prediction. For each ML model, we performed Hyperparameter tuning to get the better models and report the better models.
  
  * Here are the algorithms used:
  
      1. Linear regression
      
      2. Lasso
